- Use simple, clear icons for symptoms on the Home Page and Calendar. Icons should complement the color palette with a line-art style.
- Card-based design for the Home Page to organize content into digestible sections. Use full-screen layouts for the onboarding process for focus.
- Subtle transitions and animations on button presses to give feedback and a sense of smooth operation.
